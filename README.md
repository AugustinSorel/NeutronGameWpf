# Neutron Game

# Game Description

## Goal

This is a two players game. The goal of each player is to bring the Neutron to their home rank (the first rank on their side of the board). 
The player can either bring the Neutron to their home rank during their turn, or have the other player bring it over there which only normally happens if forced upon during their turn. 
The other way to win, is to stalemate the other player, that is, by not allowing the other player complete their turn which consist of moving the Neutron first, 
and then one of their soldiers (except on the first player's first turn where they can only move a soldier).

## Rule

* The game starts with five red pieces on the player1 home row (one edge of the board), five green pieces on player2 home row, and the neutron in the center.
* All pieces move in a straight line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, but they must move as far as they can go in the chosen direction. They can only move through or onto empty squares and there is no capturing.
* Play begins with one player moving a piece from the home row. Thereafter on each turn, a player moves first the neutron and then one of his or her pieces.
* The object of the game is to move the neutron into your home row, cause your opponent to move the neutron into your home row, or to block the neutron completely so your opponent can't move it.
